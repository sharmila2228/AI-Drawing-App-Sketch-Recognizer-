# AI-Drawing-App-Sketch-Recognizer-
üñåÔ∏è Project Description ‚Äì AI Drawing App (Sketch Recognizer):
The AI Drawing App is an interactive application that allows users to draw on a digital canvas and uses artificial intelligence to recognize and classify the sketch in real-time. Built using Python, Tkinter (for GUI), and a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model (such as one trained on the MNIST dataset), the app captures the user's drawing, preprocesses the image, and predicts what the user drew ‚Äî such as a number or basic shape. It provides instant feedback, making it a simple yet effective tool to demonstrate the power of machine learning in computer vision. This project is ideal for beginners exploring AI and image recognition and can be extended for educational games, handwriting input, or visual learning tools.The AI Drawing App (Sketch Recognizer) is a beginner-friendly artificial intelligence project that combines a graphical user interface with machine learning to recognize freehand sketches or digits. The application allows users to draw directly on a virtual canvas using a mouse or touch input. Once the drawing is complete, the system captures the canvas, processes the image (such as resizing and normalizing), and sends it to a pre-trained machine learning model, typically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

This model analyzes the input and identifies the most likely class, such as a handwritten digit (0‚Äì9), and displays the result in real time. The app demonstrates a practical implementation of AI in computer vision, offering a hands-on learning experience for users interested in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and image processing.

The system is developed using Python with Tkinter for the interface, Pillow for image handling, and TensorFlow/Keras for model prediction. It uses the popular MNIST dataset for digit recognition, though it can be extended to recognize objects, shapes, or letters using custom datasets.

This project not only introduces key AI concepts in a visual and engaging way but also serves as a base for advanced applications such as:

Educational tools for kids

Drawing-based learning games

Assistive technology for handwriting recognition

Digitized input systems
